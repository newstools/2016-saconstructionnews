Bombela concession company recieves quantum award in the Gautrain Sandton Station.The Gautrain Sandton Station Cavern Claim, on its merits, was ruled in favour of BCC in October 2013. On 2 March 2016, the arbitration tribunal announced the provisional quantum award of R354 million.The amount due must be finalised by escalating the value of the award from the date on which the costs were incurred to the date on which the award was issued, based on its constituent parts of Rands and Euros. Province is liable for all arbitration costs related to this matter and has to pay interest at the prime overdraft rate plus 2% from the date of finalisation of the amount due.Murray &amp; Roberts is satisfied with the outcome of the proceedings and it further strengthens our confidence in the company s entitlement with respect to unresolved claims on the Gautrain project due for resolution.
