A R178 million Department of Transport and Public Works project to rehabilitate and resurface sections of the R311 and R45 in the Moorreesburg area is progressing well.Construction started in June 2015 and is now scheduled for completion by July 2017.The project was delayed due to unforeseen ground condition problems, but a revised construction programme will minimise the risk of further delays. Work on major storm water structures was completed in April 2016. Major layer work to rehabilitate and improve the structure of existing roads is currently under way.Half-width construction is in progress and traffic flow is being managed using a stop/ go system during the day, and a traffic light system at night. The half-width sections are no more than 4 km long and stop/ go signs will be at least 3 km apart to minimise motorist frustration. For safety reasons, the speed limit has been reduced to 60 km/h where there are roadworks. Two stop/go systems will be in place during the festive season and site personnel are on standby for any emergency. Regular route patrols will proactively identify and address any traffic issues. Motorists can expect delays of up to 10 minutes per stop/ go closure during the festive period. The Department remains committed to socio-economic development, empowerment, and employment. So far, the project has generated a total of 50 000 person-days of work for labourers from the Swartland municipal area, and over R11million has been spent on targeted enterprises. This project will improve the local road network and benefit the local community for a long time to come. We thank you for your patience and cooperation.Over 2 000 vehicles travel daily on the R311 between the N7 and Moorreesburg (Main Road 230), and over 800 vehicles travel daily on the R311 between Moorreesburg and the R45 (Main Road 231). Motorists will soon be able to enjoy a safer and more pleasant travelling experience on these roads.
