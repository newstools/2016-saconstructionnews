Construction industry turns deeply pessimistic in the final quarter of 2016, shows poll of civil engineering firms by Stellenbosch University's Bureau for Economic Research. SA s construction industry turned deeply pessimistic in the final quarter of 2016 a poll of civil engineering firms by Stellenbosch University s Bureau for Economic Research released on Tuesday showed.The First National Bank (FNB) sponsored civil confidence index tumbled to 35 points in the fourth quarter from 52 points in the third quarter.This equates to only 35% of civil engineers being satisfied with industry conditions now compared with more than half in the third quarter.Despite the government s recent commitment to invest more than R900bn in infrastructure over the next three years there had been a reduction in government contracts in the industry FNB senior economic analyst Jason Muscat said.Construction work by the private sector mainly mining was probably also lower during the quarter. This was a perfect storm. The weaker activity as well as increased tendering price competition took its toll on overall profitability. In fact the index measuring profitability declined to its lowest level in two years Muscat said.The survey findings tallied with Statistics SA data that showed annual growth in the real value of construction works contracted by 1.5% in the third quarter in addition to the 0.3% decline recorded in the second quarter. A large part of the weaker demand stems from a fall in government capital expenditure amid mounting fiscal pressures. Despite the deterioration in their fortunes civil contractors expect some improvement in activity next quarter. This is somewhat supported by the constraint measuring new demand which although reasonably high is below its five-year average Muscat said. While it is important to take note of respondents expectations the underlying economic fundamentals do not suggest a much improved civil construction sector in the near future said Muscat.source: BDpro
