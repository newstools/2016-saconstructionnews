The construction of the long-awaited new clinic in Louwville, Vredenburg is nearing completion.This R8 million project to convert the community library building into a health facility was commissioned by the Department of Transport and Public Works (DTPW) for the Western Cape Department of Health to respond to an increase in patient numbers. Construction started in March 2016 and is expected to have been completed in March 2017, if all goes according to plan.Once it has been completed, the new facility will be fully accessible to people with disabilities. It will offer primary healthcare services including treatment of infectious diseases, curative and chronic care, and rehabilitation services. The clinic will have separate consultation rooms, wound care and treatment rooms, as well as a pharmacy.When it has opened, the new clinic will help to give effect to the Healthcare 2030 aim of providing high-quality health facilities for the people of the Western Cape at district hospital and primary healthcare level. Modernising and maintaining our health infrastructure is central to delivering on that commitment. When our infrastructure is fit for purpose, the provincial government is able to provide the quality patient-centred care which people can rely on.
