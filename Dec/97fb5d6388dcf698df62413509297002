The Department of Transport and Public Works (DTPW) project to rehabilitate 7 km of the N2 between Borcherds Quarry Rd and the R300, and to add a third lane in both directions, is 64% complete.This R186 million project began in January 2016 and is expected to have been completed in mid-2017.Motorists are warned that the contractor has had to narrow the road from four lanes to two just after the Symphony Way bridge on the inbound side. This lane convergence is clearly signposted and will remain in place throughout the December/ January holiday period. The travelling public is advised to strictly adhere to the temporary speed limits for safety reasons.About 82 000 vehicles travel on the affected stretch of road every day. The upgrade will improve the carrying capacity of the road, especially for buses and taxis during peak periods. The ride quality of the road will be improved and better street lighting will be installed. Every attempt will be made to facilitate the flow of traffic and minimise delays.DTPW is committed to creating short-term Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP) employment and skills training opportunities. Locally based emerging contractors have successfully installed new subsoil drainage systems. Contract expenditure to date is R12 million for targeted enterprises. A total of 12 015 person-days of work have been created so far for 80 men and 13 women from the City of Cape Town municipal area.DTPW values the importance of high-quality road infrastructure as an important component of an effective transport system. This infrastructure also makes a substantial contribution to productivity, safety and economic development in the province.
