A Department of Transport and Public Works (DTPW) contract to rehabilitate and resurface the R43 between Worcester and Wyzersdrift, including a section through Rawsonville, is approximately 50% complete.Work on this R227 million contract commenced in April 2015 and is expected to have been completed in October 2017. Work to widen the Breede River Bridge is proceeding well. The widening of the bridge piers has been completed and the widening of the deck on one side is nearing completion.Work commenced at the beginning of 2016 to completely rehabilitate the main road through Rawsonville. This includes the relocation of services and the installation of storm water pipes. This part of the project is progressing slowly due to difficulties encountered with existing underground high voltage cables.Although much of the contract requires one-way stop-go traffic control measures, this has been limited to minimise delays during the harvest season. Contract expenditure to date is R92,9 million, including R20 million for targeted enterprises. A total of 55 000 person-days of work have been created so far for 210 people from the Breede Valley municipal area.The high-quality road infrastructure that DTPW provides is an important component of a safe and effective transport system, and an enabler of economic and social development in the Western Cape.
