Stefanutti Stocks says its interim results to August reflect sustained market pressure in both the South African and regional construction sector.Contract revenue plunged from R5.3bn in the period in 2015 to R4.4bn in 2016, as operating profit before investment income slid from R176m to R100m. But headline earnings per share were up 8.8%. The South African construction market remains challenging, with escalating levels of competition for the limited available work, CEO Willie Meyburgh said on Thursday. Currency fluctuations in the countries in which the group operates also impacted on the group s financial performance for the period. The multidisciplinary construction group operates in SA, sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, where it garnered nearly R22m of tax-free profits of equity-accounted investees.But Meyburgh said the group had been negatively affected by R50m in currency fluctuations, along with a lack of both private and public infrastructure spend in Southern Africa.Referring to the limited work available, he said: It is about time that the government invested in water infrastructure for treatment and distribution. Diluted headline earnings per share from total operations were 48.50c, up 7.6% from 45.07c in the period in 2015.Antonio Cocciante, chief financial officer of Stefanutti Stocks, said on Thursday that the group s tax had been reduced significantly from R52m in the period in 2015 to R15m in 2016.Dexter Mahachi, an analyst at Momentum SP Reid Securities, said: While Stefanutti s results are down on the previous year, we are relatively positive on the company s strong cash position, reduced debt levels and strong order book. We believe that the recently announced settlement with the government augurs well for the construction sector in general despite the continued litigation by some quasi-government institutions. source: Business Day
